{"id":"bd-eye-06a","title":"Support Dolt databases alongside SQLite","description":"Detect whether the backing store is a Dolt database or SQLite and use the appropriate driver.\n\n## Context\n\nbd-eye currently assumes a SQLite database via better-sqlite3 (synchronous, readonly WAL mode). Beads itself supports Dolt as a backend. bd-eye should be able to read from either.\n\n## Detection strategy\n\n- If the resolved path is a directory containing a `.dolt` subdirectory, treat as Dolt\n- If the resolved path is a `.db` file, treat as SQLite\n- The `BEADS_DB` env var and auto-discovery logic in `resolveDbPath()` already resolve to a path — detection layers on top of that\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n### 1. Make the Db interface async\n\nThe `Db` typedef in `src/server/db.js` (line 41-53) currently returns synchronous values. All methods need to return `Promise\u003cT\u003e` to support both sync (better-sqlite3) and async (mysql2) drivers.\n\n**Files affected:**\n- `src/server/db.js` — change typedef, wrap better-sqlite3 calls in `Promise.resolve()` or use `async` functions\n- `src/server/routes/issues.js` — add `await` to every `db.*()` call, make route handlers `async`\n- `src/server/index.js` — `await openDb()` at startup\n\n### 2. Extract SQLite implementation\n\nMove the current better-sqlite3 implementation into `src/server/db-sqlite.js`, exporting a function with the same `openDb` signature that returns a `Db`.\n\n### 3. Create Dolt implementation\n\nNew file `src/server/db-dolt.js`:\n- Connect to Dolt SQL server via `mysql2/promise`\n- Implement the same `Db` interface\n- Connection config from env vars: `DOLT_HOST`, `DOLT_PORT`, `DOLT_USER`, `DOLT_PASSWORD`, `DOLT_DATABASE`\n- The SQL queries are standard and should transfer directly\n- Views `ready_issues` and `blocked_issues` must exist in the Dolt schema (beads creates these)\n\n### 4. Add detection and factory in db.js\n\n`src/server/db.js` becomes a thin dispatcher:\n- `resolveDbPath()` — unchanged\n- `detectDbType(path)` — returns `'sqlite' | 'dolt'` based on path characteristics\n- `openDb(path)` — calls the appropriate implementation\n\n### 5. Adapt the file watcher\n\n`src/server/watcher.js` currently watches SQLite WAL/SHM files via chokidar. For Dolt:\n- Option A: Poll `DOLT_LOG()` or `HASHOF('HEAD')` on an interval to detect commits\n- Option B: Watch the `.dolt/noms` directory for file changes\n- Extract a `createWatcher(dbType, path, onChange)` factory\n\n### 6. Update configuration\n\n- Add new env vars to `.env.example`: `DOLT_HOST`, `DOLT_PORT`, `DOLT_USER`, `DOLT_PASSWORD`, `DOLT_DATABASE`\n- Update README with Dolt setup instructions\n- Add `mysql2` as an optional/peer dependency\n\n## Key risks\n\n- The sync-to-async migration touches every route handler — keep the diff minimal by making SQLite impl async too\n- Dolt SQL server must be running separately — document this clearly\n- Views (`ready_issues`, `blocked_issues`) must exist in Dolt — verify beads creates them for Dolt backends","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","assignee":"Daniel Chicot","owner":"daniel.chicot@dlapiper.com","created_at":"2026-02-15T16:50:54Z","created_by":"Daniel Chicot","updated_at":"2026-02-19T12:09:31Z","closed_at":"2026-02-15T17:19:41Z","work_type":"mutex"}

Each bar segment has a vertical gradient fade for depth on dark background. Not a boring flat bar chart.\n\n### Key Visual Elements\n\n- **Stacked bars**: One per time bucket, segments stacked by issue type. Vertical gradient (full → 55% opacity) gives subtle depth\n- **Moving average line**: 3-period rolling average as smooth cubic bezier curve in accent blue at 70% opacity, with small circles at data points\n- **Bar glow on hover**: SVG `feGaussianBlur` + `feMerge` filter brightens hovered bar. Non-matching types dim to 18% opacity\n- **Responsive via ResizeObserver**: SVG redraws at container width. Height clamped to 35% aspect ratio\n- **X-axis label thinning**: Labels printed every N bars, scaling with bucket count\n- **Type breakdown panel**: Below chart, each type gets a row with mini sparkline (80x28 SVG), count, and percentage bar\n\n### Component Structure\n\n\\`\\`\\`\nThroughputChart            — root, owns state, fetches issues\n  StatCard                 — individual stat (total, avg, best, trend)\n  TypeLegend               — pill buttons to filter-highlight types\n  BucketToggle             — Day | Week | Month segmented control\n  SvgChart                 — pure SVG, all data as props\n    \u003cdefs\u003e                 — gradients + glow filter\n    y-tick lines + labels\n    bar \u003cg\u003e groups         — stacked \u003crect\u003e segments + x-label\n    moving average \u003cpath\u003e + \u003ccircle\u003e points\n  Tooltip                  — absolute-positioned HTML overlay\n  TypeBreakdownRow (x4)    — sparkline + bar + count per type\n    MiniSparkline          — tiny 80x28 SVG area fill + bezier + end dot\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n### Bucketing Logic\n\n\\`buildBuckets(issues, granularity)\\` pure function:\n1.

Minimal UI, discoverable.\n**B) Settings panel**: A board-level settings icon that opens a modal/drawer where you configure limits for all columns. More structured, but heavier.\n**C) FilterBar control**: Add a WIP config toggle alongside existing filter controls. Consistent with existing UI patterns.\n\n### Persistence — choose one approach later\n**A) localStorage**: Simplest, no server changes. Limits persist per browser.
