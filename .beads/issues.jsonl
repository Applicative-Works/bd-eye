{"id":"bd-eye-06a","title":"Support Dolt databases alongside SQLite","description":"Detect whether the backing store is a Dolt database or SQLite and use the appropriate driver.\n\n## Context\n\nbd-eye currently assumes a SQLite database via better-sqlite3 (synchronous, readonly WAL mode). Beads itself supports Dolt as a backend. bd-eye should be able to read from either.\n\n## Detection strategy\n\n- If the resolved path is a directory containing a `.dolt` subdirectory, treat as Dolt\n- If the resolved path is a `.db` file, treat as SQLite\n- The `BEADS_DB` env var and auto-discovery logic in `resolveDbPath()` already resolve to a path — detection layers on top of that\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n### 1. Make the Db interface async\n\nThe `Db` typedef in `src/server/db.js` (line 41-53) currently returns synchronous values. All methods need to return `Promise\u003cT\u003e` to support both sync (better-sqlite3) and async (mysql2) drivers.\n\n**Files affected:**\n- `src/server/db.js` — change typedef, wrap better-sqlite3 calls in `Promise.resolve()` or use `async` functions\n- `src/server/routes/issues.js` — add `await` to every `db.*()` call, make route handlers `async`\n- `src/server/index.js` — `await openDb()` at startup\n\n### 2. Extract SQLite implementation\n\nMove the current better-sqlite3 implementation into `src/server/db-sqlite.js`, exporting a function with the same `openDb` signature that returns a `Db`.\n\n### 3. Create Dolt implementation\n\nNew file `src/server/db-dolt.js`:\n- Connect to Dolt SQL server via `mysql2/promise`\n- Implement the same `Db` interface\n- Connection config from env vars: `DOLT_HOST`, `DOLT_PORT`, `DOLT_USER`, `DOLT_PASSWORD`, `DOLT_DATABASE`\n- The SQL queries are standard and should transfer directly\n- Views `ready_issues` and `blocked_issues` must exist in the Dolt schema (beads creates these)\n\n### 4. Add detection and factory in db.js\n\n`src/server/db.js` becomes a thin dispatcher:\n- `resolveDbPath()` — unchanged\n- `detectDbType(path)` — returns `'sqlite' | 'dolt'` based on path characteristics\n- `openDb(path)` — calls the appropriate implementation\n\n### 5. Adapt the file watcher\n\n`src/server/watcher.js` currently watches SQLite WAL/SHM files via chokidar. For Dolt:\n- Option A: Poll `DOLT_LOG()` or `HASHOF('HEAD')` on an interval to detect commits\n- Option B: Watch the `.dolt/noms` directory for file changes\n- Extract a `createWatcher(dbType, path, onChange)` factory\n\n### 6. Update configuration\n\n- Add new env vars to `.env.example`: `DOLT_HOST`, `DOLT_PORT`, `DOLT_USER`, `DOLT_PASSWORD`, `DOLT_DATABASE`\n- Update README with Dolt setup instructions\n- Add `mysql2` as an optional/peer dependency\n\n## Key risks\n\n- The sync-to-async migration touches every route handler — keep the diff minimal by making SQLite impl async too\n- Dolt SQL server must be running separately — document this clearly\n- Views (`ready_issues`, `blocked_issues`) must exist in Dolt — verify beads creates them for Dolt backends","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","assignee":"Daniel Chicot","owner":"daniel.chicot@dlapiper.com","created_at":"2026-02-15T16:50:54Z","created_by":"Daniel Chicot","updated_at":"2026-02-19T12:09:31Z","closed_at":"2026-02-15T17:19:41Z","work_type":"mutex"}

Each bar segment has a vertical gradient fade for depth on dark background. Not a boring flat bar chart.\n\n### Key Visual Elements\n\n- **Stacked bars**: One per time bucket, segments stacked by issue type. Vertical gradient (full → 55% opacity) gives subtle depth\n- **Moving average line**: 3-period rolling average as smooth cubic bezier curve in accent blue at 70% opacity, with small circles at data points\n- **Bar glow on hover**: SVG `feGaussianBlur` + `feMerge` filter brightens hovered bar. Non-matching types dim to 18% opacity\n- **Responsive via ResizeObserver**: SVG redraws at container width. Height clamped to 35% aspect ratio\n- **X-axis label thinning**: Labels printed every N bars, scaling with bucket count\n- **Type breakdown panel**: Below chart, each type gets a row with mini sparkline (80x28 SVG), count, and percentage bar\n\n### Component Structure\n\n\\`\\`\\`\nThroughputChart            — root, owns state, fetches issues\n  StatCard                 — individual stat (total, avg, best, trend)\n  TypeLegend               — pill buttons to filter-highlight types\n  BucketToggle             — Day | Week | Month segmented control\n  SvgChart                 — pure SVG, all data as props\n    \u003cdefs\u003e                 — gradients + glow filter\n    y-tick lines + labels\n    bar \u003cg\u003e groups         — stacked \u003crect\u003e segments + x-label\n    moving average \u003cpath\u003e + \u003ccircle\u003e points\n  Tooltip                  — absolute-positioned HTML overlay\n  TypeBreakdownRow (x4)    — sparkline + bar + count per type\n    MiniSparkline          — tiny 80x28 SVG area fill + bezier + end dot\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n### Bucketing Logic\n\n\\`buildBuckets(issues, granularity)\\` pure function:\n1.

{"id":"bd-eye-ja6","title":"Project switcher","description":"Multi-project navigation allowing bd-eye to point at multiple beads databases and switch between them.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Architecture\nOne Dolt server serves multiple databases via `--data-dir`. bd-eye discovers valid beads databases via `SHOW DATABASES` + table validation. API routes gain a `/:project/` path segment. Connection pools are lazily created per database.\n\n### Phase 1: Backend — Multi-Database Infrastructure\n\n**Step 1: `src/server/db-registry.js`** (new)\n- `Map\u003cstring, Db\u003e` pool registry\n- `connectionFor(name, baseConfig)` — returns cached or opens new via `openDoltDb`\n- `closeAll()`, `openDbs()`\n\n**Step 2: `src/server/routes/projects.js`** (new)\n- `GET /api/projects` — `SHOW DATABASES`, filter system DBs, validate each has `issues` table\n- Returns `{ projects: [{ name, issueCount }] }`\n\n**Step 3: `src/server/routes/issues.js`** (modify)\n- Change `issueRoutes(db)` to `issueRoutes(dbFor)`\n- Add middleware: `c.set('db', await dbFor(c.req.param('project')))`\n- All handlers change from closed-over `db` to `c.get('db')`\n\n**Step 4: `src/server/index.js`** (modify)\n- Wire registry, project routes, project-scoped issue routes\n- Routes become: `/api/projects` and `/api/projects/:project/*`\n- Shutdown calls `closeAll()`\n\n**Step 5: `src/server/watcher.js`** (modify)\n- Track `DOLT_HASHOF_DB()` per database name\n- Broadcast includes project name in SSE data\n\n**Step 6: `src/server/db.js`** (modify)\n- Export `SYSTEM_DBS`\n\n### Phase 2: Frontend — Project State and API Layer\n\n**Step 7: `src/client/state.js`** (modify)\n- Add signals: `currentProject`, `projectList`, `projectsLoading`\n- Subscribe `currentProject` to localStorage (`bd-eye-project`)\n\n**Step 8: `src/client/hooks/useProjects.js`** (new)\n- Fetch `/api/projects`, populate signals\n- Auto-select from localStorage or first alphabetically\n\n**Step 9: `src/client/api.js`** (new)\n- `apiUrl(path)` → `/api/projects/${currentProject.value}${path}`\n- All components use this instead of hardcoded paths\n\n**Step 10: `src/client/hooks/useIssues.js`** (modify)\n- Use `apiUrl`, re-fetch when project changes\n\n**Step 11: `src/client/hooks/useLiveUpdates.js`** (modify)\n- Parse SSE event data, filter by `currentProject`\n\n**Step 12: Update all direct fetch calls** — Board.jsx, DetailPanel.jsx, DependencyGraph.jsx, EpicExplorer.jsx, FilterBar.jsx, SearchModal.jsx → use `apiUrl`\n\n### Phase 3: Frontend — Project Switcher Component\n\n**Step 13: `src/client/components/ProjectSwitcher.jsx`** (new)\n- 0 projects: \"No projects found\"\n- 1 project: plain text, no interaction\n- 2+ projects: dropdown with check mark, issue counts, keyboard nav\n- Updates `document.title` on project change\n\n**Step 14: `src/client/components/NavBar.jsx`** (modify)\n- Insert ProjectSwitcher between app name and nav tabs\n\n**Step 15: `src/client/components/App.jsx`** (modify)\n- Call `useProjects()`, show skeleton while loading, empty state if no projects\n\n### Phase 4: Styling\n\n**Step 16: `src/styles/main.css`** — project switcher dropdown, active states, skeleton shimmer\n\n### Phase 5: Testing\n\n**Step 17:** `tests/db-registry.test.js` — pool caching, closeAll, openDbs\n**Step 18:** `tests/routes-projects.test.js` — discovery, filtering, validation\n**Step 19:** `tests/routes-issues.test.js` — update paths to project-scoped\n**Step 20:** `tests/client/ProjectSwitcher.test.jsx` — single/multi/empty modes\n**Step 21:** Update `tests/client/useIssues.test.jsx` — project-aware URLs\n**Step 22:** Update `tests/client/NavBar.test.jsx` — ProjectSwitcher present\n\n### Build Sequence\n1. db.js (export SYSTEM_DBS) → 2. db-registry.js → 3. routes/projects.js → 4. routes/issues.js refactor → 5. index.js wiring → 6. watcher.js → 7-9. server tests → 10. state.js signals → 11. api.js helper → 12. useProjects.js → 13. useIssues.js → 14. useLiveUpdates.js → 15. update 7 components → 16. ProjectSwitcher.jsx → 17. NavBar.jsx → 18. App.jsx → 19. CSS → 20. client tests\n\n### Key Decisions\n- **Path prefix** `/api/projects/:project/` over query params — cleaner URLs, natural Hono routing\n- **Lazy pool creation** — pools opened on first request, not at startup\n- **Centralised `apiUrl` helper** — minimises file changes, reads from signal\n- **SSE stays global** — one connection, client-side project filtering","design":"## Research Findings: Dolt Multi-Database Discovery\n\n### Key Finding\nOne Dolt SQL server can serve multiple databases via directory-based discovery:\n- `dolt sql-server` looks in its working directory and **one level of subdirectories** for `.dolt` directories\n- Each directory containing `.dolt` becomes a separate database, named after the directory\n- The `--data-dir` flag (or `data_dir` in YAML config) points the server at any parent directory\n- `SHOW DATABASES` lists all available projects; `USE \u003cdatabase\u003e` switches between them\n\n### Implication for Project Switcher\nThe discovery problem dissolves — no process sniffing or port scanning needed:\n1. One Dolt server started with `--data-dir` pointing at a parent containing beads project databases\n2. `discoverDoltDatabase()` in db.js already does `SHOW DATABASES` — extend it to list all databases instead of erroring on multiple\n3. Switching is a new connection pool with a different `database` field\n\n---\n\n## UX Design Spec\n\n### Placement: Nav bar, between app name and nav links\n\n```\n[ Beady Eye ]  [ project-name ▾ ]  |  Board  Ready  Epics  Deps  Activity  Throughput  |  ⌘K\n```\n\nThe project switcher is always visible — the current project is fundamental context.\n\n### Current project display\n- Muted but legible style, slightly less prominent than nav links\n- Clickable with subtle border on hover\n- **Single project**: plain text, no chevron, not interactive\n- **Multi-project**: dropdown button with chevron\n\n### Switching interaction\n- **Click switcher** → small dropdown anchored below the button\n- Current project has a check mark; arrow keys navigate, Enter selects, Escape closes\n- No search input unless projects \u003e 8 (then add filter input at top)\n- **⌘K** also accepts project names as secondary path\n\n### Loading/transition on switch\n1. Project name updates immediately (optimistic)\n2. Nav links gray out (pointer-events: none, opacity: 0.5)\n3. Board shows skeleton/shimmer over existing column structure — cards replaced with placeholder bars\n4. On data loaded: cards fade in ~150ms\n- No full-page spinner — skeleton preserves spatial continuity\n\n### First load behaviour\n- Auto-select last-used project from `localStorage` key `bd-eye.lastProject`\n- If stored project no longer valid, fall back to first alphabetically\n- First ever visit: auto-select first project, show one-time toast: \"Viewing project-name — switch projects from the top bar\" (dismiss on click or after 4s)\n- No interstitial picker — board renders immediately\n\n### Empty state (no valid projects)\n- Centred message: \"No beads projects found\" with explanation and Refresh button\n- Nav bar renders but switcher slot empty, nav links grayed out\n\n### Browser tab title\n`project-name — Beady Eye` — updated on every switch\n\n### Robustness\n- Filter `SHOW DATABASES` to exclude system databases (information_schema, mysql, sys, performance_schema)\n- Validate each candidate database has an `issues` table before listing\n- Skip empty or non-beads databases gracefully\n\n### Summary\n\n| Concern | Decision |\n|---|---|\n| Placement | Nav bar, left of nav links |\n| Single project | Plain text label, no interaction |\n| Multi-project | Dropdown off the label button |\n| ⌘K | Also accepts project switching, secondary path |\n| Transition | Skeleton over existing board structure |\n| First load | Auto-select last used, or first alphabetically |\n| Empty state | Full board replaced, refresh button |\n| Tab title | `project-name — Beady Eye` |","notes":"## Session 2026-02-19: Implementation Complete\n\nAll backend and frontend code implemented and tested (494 tests passing).\n\n### What's done\n- db-registry.js with lazy connection pools\n- /api/projects endpoint with discovery\n- Project-scoped issue routes (/api/projects/:project/*)\n- Multi-database watcher polling\n- ProjectSwitcher component with dropdown, keyboard nav, pretty names\n- All views updated to use apiUrl() helper\n- Migration script (scripts/migrate-dolt-databases.sh) — fixed to handle all dolt directory naming patterns\n\n### Pretty names\nStrips beads_ prefix, converts dashes/underscores to spaces, sentence case.\ne.g. beads_code-quality-dashboard → \"Code quality dashboard\"\n\n### Pending\n- Live browser testing to verify end-to-end","status":"closed","priority":4,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"daniel.chicot@dlapiper.com","created_at":"2026-02-19T11:09:49Z","created_by":"Daniel Chicot","updated_at":"2026-02-19T17:51:01Z","closed_at":"2026-02-19T17:51:01Z","close_reason":"Project switcher fully implemented with multi-database support, pretty names, migration script, and README docs","labels":["complexity:high","impact:medium"]}

{"id":"bd-eye-ufp","title":"Cross-project dependencies","description":"Visualise and manage dependencies between issues across different beads projects. Beads prefixes already namespace issues","design":"## Design: Cross-project dependencies via metadata\n\n### Storage: `metadata.cross_deps`\n\nStore cross-project dependency refs in the issue metadata JSON column:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"cross_deps\": {\n    \"blocked_by\": [\"infra-abc\", \"platform-xyz\"],\n    \"blocks\": [\"frontend-def\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEach side of the relationship stores its half. No schema migration, no new dolt tables — just structured JSON in the existing metadata column.\n\n### Write path\n\nWhen adding a cross-project dep, write to both project databases:\n1. On the local issue: add foreign id to `metadata.cross_deps.blocked_by` (or `blocks`)\n2. On the foreign issue: add local id to its `metadata.cross_deps.blocks` (or `blocked_by`)\n\ndb-registry already has pools for every project, so both writes are straightforward.\n\n### Read path\n\nWhen rendering a card or detail panel, merge two sources:\n- `dependenciesFor(id)` — in-project deps from the dependencies table (existing)\n- `metadata.cross_deps` — cross-project refs\n\nFor each foreign ref, do a lightweight fetch from the other project pool (id, title, status) to show whether the blocker is resolved.\n\n### UI\n\n**DetailPanel**: Add a \"cross-project dependency\" button. Picker flow:\n1. Select target project (from db-registry project list)\n2. Search/select issue in that project\n3. Choose relationship direction (blocked_by / blocks)\n4. Writes metadata on both sides\n\n**Card**: Show cross-project blocker count alongside existing blocked_by indicator, visually distinguished (e.g. prefixed with project name or different icon).\n\n**DependencyGraph**: Render foreign nodes with distinct styling (different colour/shape, labelled with project prefix).\n\n### What stays unchanged\n\n- Dolt schema — no migration needed\n- Beads CLI — sees opaque JSON in metadata, no changes required\n- In-project dependencies — still use the dependencies table as before\n- API dependency routes — existing `/issues/:id/dependencies` unchanged\n\n### Sync concern\n\nBoth sides must be written atomically-ish. If the foreign project write fails, roll back the local metadata write. Since these are separate dolt databases there is no real transaction across them — best-effort with error handling is pragmatic enough for a P4 feature.","notes":"Cross-project dependencies would let you see and manage dependency links between issues in different beads projects.\n\n## Problem\nThe dependency graph only shows links within a single project. If an issue is blocked by something in a different project (e.g. an infra task), that blocker is invisible.\n\n## How it would work\n- `bd dep add bd-eye-abc infra-def` — the prefix tells beads the dependency crosses projects\n- The API resolves foreign-project issues by querying the other project dolt database via db-registry\n- Board shows cross-project blockers on cards (foreign prefix highlighted)\n- DependencyGraph renders foreign nodes differently (greyed out, different shape, or labelled with project name)\n- DetailPanel dependency section shows the foreign issue title/status even though it lives elsewhere\n\n## Why complexity:high, impact:low\nTouches multiple layers (beads CLI, API dependency routes, multi-project db-registry, several UI components), but most teams keep dependencies within a single project. Power-user feature — leave on backlog unless cross-project blocking pain is actually felt.","status":"open","priority":4,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"daniel.chicot@dlapiper.com","created_at":"2026-02-19T11:09:50Z","created_by":"Daniel Chicot","updated_at":"2026-02-19T21:32:48Z","labels":["complexity:high","impact:low"]}
