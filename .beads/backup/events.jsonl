Beads itself supports Dolt as a backend. bd-eye should be able to read from either.\\n\\n## Detection strategy\\n\\n- If the resolved path is a directory containing a `.dolt` subdirectory, treat as Dolt\\n- If the resolved path is a `.db` file, treat as SQLite\\n- The `BEADS_DB` env var and auto-discovery logic in `resolveDbPath()` already resolve to a path — detection layers on top of that\\n\\n## Implementation plan\\n\\n### 1. Make the Db interface async\\n\\nThe `Db` typedef in `src/server/db.js` (line 41-53) currently returns synchronous values. All methods need to return `Promise\\u003cT\\u003e` to support both sync (better-sqlite3) and async (mysql2) drivers.\\n\\n**Files affected:**\\n- `src/server/db.js` — change typedef, wrap better-sqlite3 calls in `Promise.resolve()` or use `async` functions\\n- `src/server/routes/issues.js` — add `await` to every `db.*()` call, make route handlers `async`\\n- `src/server/index.js` — `await openDb()` at startup\\n\\n### 2. Extract SQLite implementation\\n\\nMove the current better-sqlite3 implementation into `src/server/db-sqlite.js`, exporting a function with the same `openDb` signature that returns a `Db`.\\n\\n### 3. Create Dolt implementation\\n\\nNew file `src/server/db-dolt.js`:\\n- Connect to Dolt SQL server via `mysql2/promise`\\n- Implement the same `Db` interface\\n- Connection config from env vars: `DOLT_HOST`, `DOLT_PORT`, `DOLT_USER`, `DOLT_PASSWORD`, `DOLT_DATABASE`\\n- The SQL queries are standard and should transfer directly\\n- Views `ready_issues` and `blocked_issues` must exist in the Dolt schema (beads creates these)\\n\\n### 4. Add detection and factory in db.js\\n\\n`src/server/db.js` becomes a thin dispatcher:\\n- `resolveDbPath()` — unchanged\\n- `detectDbType(path)` — returns `'sqlite' | 'dolt'` based on path characteristics\\n- `openDb(path)` — calls the appropriate implementation\\n\\n### 5. Adapt the file watcher\\n\\n`src/server/watcher.js` currently watches SQLite WAL/SHM files via chokidar. For Dolt:\\n- Option A: Poll `DOLT_LOG()` or `HASHOF('HEAD')` on an interval to detect commits\\n- Option B: Watch the `.dolt/noms` directory for file changes\\n- Extract a `createWatcher(dbType, path, onChange)` factory\\n\\n### 6. Update configuration\\n\\n- Add new env vars to `.env.example`: `DOLT_HOST`, `DOLT_PORT`, `DOLT_USER`, `DOLT_PASSWORD`, `DOLT_DATABASE`\\n- Update README with Dolt setup instructions\\n- Add `mysql2` as an optional/peer dependency\\n\\n## Key risks\\n\\n- The sync-to-async migration touches every route handler — keep the diff minimal by making SQLite impl async too\\n- Dolt SQL server must be running separately — document this clearly\\n- Views (`ready_issues`, `blocked_issues`) must exist in Dolt — verify beads creates them for Dolt backends\",\"status\":\"closed\",\"priority\":2,\"issue_type\":\"feature\",\"owner\":\"daniel.chicot@dlapiper.com\",\"created_at\":\"2026-02-15T16:50:54Z\",\"created_by\":\"Daniel Chicot\",\"updated_at\":\"2026-02-15T17:19:41Z\",\"closed_at\":\"2026-02-15T17:19:41Z\",\"work_type\":\"mutex\"}"}
